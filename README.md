<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great Discord Bots that have really cool features; however, we didn't find one that covered all of our needs so we started to develop Evee in order to just have 1 bot on our server that can do what would take 5 bots to do.

Why should you add Evee to your Discord server? Here's why:
* With Evee you can request a feature that you find really cool and we will implement it
* Why have a lot of bots with different commands and prefix when you can have just one that does everything

Of course, no bot will be a good fit in every server since your needs may be different. So we'll be adding more useful features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this bot!
